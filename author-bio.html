        <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brucevanhorn2/" target="_blank"
          >Bruce M. Van Horn II</a></strong> is a software developer who got
        his first professional coding gig at the tender age of 12, back when the
        mighty <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80" target="_blank">TRS-80</a> reigned supreme. He studied Psychology at the
        <a href="https://ou.edu" target="_blank">University of Oklahoma</a>
        where he walked into the class of Professor Charles Gettys. Dr. Gettys
        announced to the class that a freshman had “accidentally” registered for
        his junior level class and that the student needed to drop the class
        immediately because the class would be too hard. Bruce was the freshman,
        but he didn’t drop. Instead, he got the top grade in the class, as well
        as another class taught by Gettys. Having proved his mettle, Dr. Gettys
        took Bruce on as a lab assistant with his research group, <em>Decision Theory
        Laboratories</em>. The group conducted the UX research that produced
        <em>WordStar</em>, which was at the time one of the most popular word processing
        programs for the <em>Microsoft Disk Operating System (MS-DOS)</em>. The group also produced one of the first virus
        scanners and did research on using multimedia for teaching. The job was
        unpaid. Instead of money, Bruce got a key to a lab filled with equipment
        most people had never heard of at the time, but that everyone uses
        today. Bruce learned everything about PCs working with Gettys and the
        two produced some of the very first multimedia presentation systems which Dr.
        Gettys used to teach his classes.

        While at OU, Bruce befriended a young woman named Cinda. Cinda was
        confined to a wheelchair and had little use of her arms and lets. Cinda
        was partially the inspiration for the character Tom in Chapter 7. Cinda
        could write with her teeth! Her "handwriting" was nothing short of
        caligraphy.
      </p>

      <p>
        After graduating from OU, Bruce took a job with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Data_Systems" target="_blank">Electronic Data Systems</a>
        where he was fast-tracked through the world-famous Operations Development
        (OPD) program. He quickly moved from an entry-level job in tape
        operations to operating mainframe computer systems for General Motors.
        EDS offered computer-based training on everything from SQL to Visual
        Basic and this is where Bruce found his passion.
      </p>

      <p>
        A few years after leaving EDS to go work for the Boy Scouts of America,
        Bruce took a nighttime teaching position at <a href="https://www.dallascollege.edu/about/rlc/pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Richland College</a>. He went on
        to teach coding there one night per week for 25 years in addition to his
        day job as a software developer. While teaching animation at Richland,
        Bruce met Tom, who had limited use of his arms and legs, and was
        confined to a wheelchair. Tom was the other insiration for the atply
        named character in Chapter 7. Many people who met Tom misjudged him, but
        he was a briliant man who despite his handicap earned a master's degree.
        He really could type with his feet.

        In 2012, while working for the United States Marine Corps (through a
        military contracting company), Bruce was diagnosed with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatomyositis" target="_blank">dermatomyositis</a>
        (DM). DM is a rare degenerative muscle disease. At first, his doctors
        told him he wouldn’t survive. When he received his diagnosis, his
        daughter, Kitty, was 18 months old. Bruce’s wife Karina was 9 months
        pregnant with Phoebe. Shortly after the diagnosis, the software company
        he worked for eliminated his position in a layoff of one. Drawing
        motivation from his family and his faith, Bruce beat the odds, cheating
        death three times. His physical state made it hard to interview for
        work, but he was hired as the lead developer at <a href="https://www.cleartechnologies.net" target="_blank">Clear Technologies</a> on a
        startup venture called <a href="https://www.visualstorageintelligence.com" target="_blank">Visual Storage Intelligence</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The following six years were very hard. He spent most of it in a hospital bed.  Along the way, he was told he would
        never walk again, that he would never speak intelligibly again, and that
        he would never eat nachos again. The disease had destroyed the muscles
        in his back, legs, arms, and throat. He couldn’t swallow anything and
        had to have a feeding tube implanted in his stomach. The OB/GYN who delivered Phoebe encouraged the family to 
        induce Phoebe early for fear she might not otherwise meet her dad.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>Bruce often said
        (unintelligibly) that he could live without walking again, and might
        consider never talking to be a perk. But no nachos? He wasn’t having it!
        After a long fight with the disease, financially crippling medical
        bills, six courses of chemotherapy, two years of daily injections in the stomach, and thousands of prayers from
        thousands of people, the disease went into remission. Today, if you were
        to meet Bruce, you might take for granted that he stands upright, walks
        three miles every morning, eats lots of nachos, and teaches six hours a
        week at
        <a href="https://techbootcamps.smu.edu/coding/" target="_blank"
          >Southern Methodist University.</a
        ></p>
        <p>
        Almost ten years later, he’s still working on the Visual Storage
        Intelligence product team as the engineering director and Certified Scrum Master. On
        his watch, the product has gone from being a nascent start-up to
        becoming highly profitable. If you don’t count the gig he got as a
        twelve-year-old, Bruce has over 30 years of software development
        experience and nearly 30 years of experience with teaching people to
        code. He has authored video courses for LinkedIn Learning, Lynda.com,
        SkillSoft, and Packt. You can find him on
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brucevanhorn2/" target="_blank"
          >LinkedIn</a

        Bruce sometimes produces videos independently and publishes them at
        <a href="https://www.maddevskilz.com" target="_blank">maddevskillz.com</a>
        When he’s not doing that, he’s usually riding bicycles with Kitty and
        Phoebe, or driving his “Yella Jeep” over big rocks (just because they’re
        there) at <a href="https://www.nps.gov/bibe/index.htm" target="_blank">Big Bend National Park</a> in west Texas.
