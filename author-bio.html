    <p><strong>Bruce M. Van Horn II</strong> is a software developer who got his first professional coding gig at the tender age of 12, 
    back when the mighty TRS-80 reigned supreme. He studied Psychology at the <a href="https://ou.edu" target="_blank">University of Oklahoma</a> where he walked 
    into the class of Professor Charles Gettys. Dr. Gettys announced to the class that a freshman had “accidentally” 
    registered for his junior level class and that the student needed to drop the class immediately because the class 
    would be too hard. Bruce was the freshman, but he didn’t drop. Instead, he got the top grade in the class, as well 
    as another class taught by Gettys. Having proved his mettle, Dr. Gettys took Bruce on as a lab assistant at his 
    research group, Decision Theory Laboratories. The group conducted the UX research that produced WordStar, which was 
    at the time one of the most popular word processing programs for DOS. The group also produced one of the first virus 
    scanners and did research on using multimedia for teaching.  The job was unpaid.  Instead of money, Bruce got a key 
    to a lab filled with equipment most people had never heard of at the time, but that everyone uses today.  Bruce 
    learned everything about PCs working with Gettys and the two produced some of the very first multimedia presentation 
    systems Dr. Gettys used to teach his classes.</p>

    <p>While at OU, Bruce befriended a young woman named Cinda.  Cinda was confined to a wheelchair and had little use of her arms and lets.  Cinda was partially the inspiration for the character Tom in Chapter 7.  Cinda could write with her teeth!  Her "handwriting" was nothing short of caligraphy.</p>

    <p>
After graduating from OU, Bruce took a job with Electronic Data Systems where he was fast-tracked through the famous 
Operations Development (OPD) program. He quickly moved from an entry-level job in tape operations to operating mainframe 
computer systems for General Motors. EDS offered computer-based training on everything from SQL to Visual Basic and this 
is where Bruce found his passion.</p>

<p>A few years after leaving EDS to go work for the Boy Scouts of America, Bruce took a nighttime teaching position at 
Richland College. He went on to teach coding there one night per week for 25 years in addition to his day job as a software developer.
While teaching animation at Richland, Bruce met Tom, who had limited use of his arms and legs, and was confined to a wheelchair.  
Tom was the other insiration for the atply named character in Chapter 7.  Many people who met Tom misjudged him, but he 
was a briliant man who despite his handicap earned a master's degree.  He really could type with his feet. </p>

<p>In 2012, while working for the United States Marine Corps (through a military contracting company), Bruce was diagnosed with dermatomyositis (DM).  DM is a 
   rare degenerative muscle disease.  At first, his doctors told him he wouldn’t survive.  When he received his 
   diagnosis, his daughter, Kitty, was 18 months old.  Bruce’s wife Karina was 9 months pregnant with Phoebe.  Shortly 
   after the diagnosis, the software company he worked for eliminated his position in a layoff of one.    
Drawing motivation from his family and his faith, Bruce beat the odds, cheating death three times.  His physical state 
made it hard to interview for work, but he was hired as the lead developer at Clear Technologies on a startup venture 
called Visual Storage Intelligence.  

<p>The following years were very hard. Along the way, he was told he would never walk again, that he would never speak 
    intelligibly again, and that he would never eat nachos again.  The disease had destroyed the muscles in his back, 
    legs, arms, and throat.  He couldn’t swallow anything and had to have a feeding tube implanted in his stomach. 
Bruce often said (unintelligibly) that he could live without walking again, and might consider never talking to be a 
perk.  But no nachos?  He wasn’t having it!  After a long fight with the disease, financially crippling medical bills, 
six courses of chemotherapy, and thousands of prayers from thousands of people, the disease went into remission. 
Today, if you were to meet Bruce, you might take for granted that he stands upright, walks three miles every morning, 
eats lots of nachos, and teaches six hours a week at 
<a href="https://techbootcamps.smu.edu/coding/" target="_blank">Southern Methodist University.</a>  Almost ten years 
later, he’s still 
working on Visual Storage Intelligence as the engineering director and Certified Scrum Master.  On his watch, the 
product has gone from being a nascent start-up to becoming highly profitable.  If you don’t count the gig he got as a 
twelve-year-old, Bruce has over 30 years of software development experience and nearly 30 years of experience with 
teaching people to code.  He has authored video courses for LinkedIn Learning, Lynda.com, SkillSoft, and Packt.  
You can find him on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brucevanhorn2/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.  </p>
<p>Bruce sometimes produces videos 
independently and publishes them at <a href="https://www.maddevskilz.com" target="_blank">maddevskillz.com</a>  
When he’s not doing that, he’s usually riding 
bicycles with Kitty and Phoebe, or driving his “Yella Jeep” over big rocks (just because they’re there) at Big Bend 
National Park in west Texas.
