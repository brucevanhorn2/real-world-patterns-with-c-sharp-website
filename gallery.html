      <p>I have dabbled in computer generated graphics for over 20 years.  It is one of my favorite pasttimes.
         I made quite a few images, though most were UML diagrams.  Those that weren't, I created with Daz Studio.</p>

      <p>The book was published in black and white, so I wanted to present the images in color since I worked hard on producing them.</p>

                        This image was inspired by the title of the first chapter.  I wanted a nerdy guy complaining that his code had degenerated into a big ball of mud and was nothing but spaghettie code.  In the original renders, the hammer isn't really gold, since the print is black and white; you wouldn't be able to tell.  I made this one gold just for y'all!

                        <p>I was originally going to use my grandparents as the heroes, but decided my girls would make for more colorful characters.  Here we see Kitty on her Palo Duro Canyon Ranger, and Phoebe with her ever-present wrench alongside one of the early model robot arms.</p><p>The hands are all wrong because I quit working on it.  I quit working on it because the real Phoebe didn't like her character's haircut.  It took weeks to create one that met with her approval.</p>

                        It was actually useful to produce these images because I felt like I really built the factory I was writing about.  This allowed me to include details both in the story and the code.
