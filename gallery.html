      <p>I have dabbled in computer generated graphics for over 20 years.  It is one of my favorite pasttimes.
         I made quite a few images, though most were UML diagrams.  Those that weren't, I created with Daz Studio.</p>

      <p>The book was published in black and white, so I wanted to present the images in color since I worked hard on producing them.</p>

                        This image was inspired by the title of the first chapter.  I wanted a nerdy guy complaining that his code had degenerated into a big ball of mud and was nothing but spaghettie code.

                        <p>This is the image I submitted to the publisher for consieration as the cover of the book.  Publishers generally have strict rules and guidelines for what they use for cover images.  This one didn't meet those guidelines, so it couldn't be used.</p>
                        
                        <p>The production manager liked the image, so they suggested using it as a frontispiece for the book.</p>

                        It was actually useful to produce these images because I felt like I really built the factory I was writing about.  This allowed me to include details both in the story and the code.
