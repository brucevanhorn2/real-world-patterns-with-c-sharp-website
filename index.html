            An AHA! moment with software design patterns
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="block">
            For 30 years now I have derived a great deal of satisfaction
            teaching new and new-ish software developers our trade. There's just
            something about seeing the AHA! moment when suddenly a tough or
            opaque concept clicks in my colleague's mind. The world for them has
            opened to new possibilities, even if they are small. When Packt
            Publishing approached me about a book on design patterns, I jumped
            at the chance.
          </p>
          <p class="block">
            Software development as a profession has been around for over 50
            years now. As an industry, we’re pretty good at teaching new
            languages, and basic theory like algorithms, data structures, Big O
            notation and the like. But there is a difference between software
            development and software engineering. Engineers need to be able to
            think about more than just syntax and clever uses of linked lists.
            They also need to learn programming paradigms and how to use software
            design patterns as both a communications tool and as an
            advantage when designing well written, easily maintainable code.
          </p>
          <p class="block">
            Developers working with C# will be able to put their knowledge to
            work with this practical guide to design patterns. The book provides
            a hands-on approach to implementation and associated methodologies
            that will have you up-and-running, and productive in no time.
          </p>
          <p class="block">
            Complete with step-by-step explanations of essential concepts,
            practical examples, and self-assessment questions, you will begin by
            exploring what patterns are. Throughout the book, you'll learn how to leverage them in your daily
            work, and even how to recognize and correct for anti-patterns that
            invariably worm their way into your projects.
          </p>
          <p class="block">
            You’ll learn to recognize solutions to common problems in software
            design with C# that come up time and again regardless of where you
            work or what industry you serve. Rather than an academic treatment
            that you’ll find in “classic” books on this topic, we’ll be
            exploring real-world applications of design patterns that you can
            use in your everyday work.
          </p>
          <p class="block">
            By the end of this book, you’ll be able to recognize situations
            where you are tempted to reinvent the wheel, and quickly avoid the
            time and cost associated with solving problems that are common, well
            understood, with battle tested, and proven design patterns.
          </p>
          <p>
            You'll wield patterns with confidence, and you do it with CLASS! And
            sometimes interfaces.

            Most books on patterns have one or more problems:

                They are written by university professors for other university
                professors. These people have never had to ship real software on
                a deadline. Learning from them is like learning to play a
                musical instrument from someone who has only ever listened to
                the radio.
                <strong
                  >This book is written in plain English by a real (but not

              <li>
                Writing a book on patterns is hard! Many authors play it safe
                and make every example super-vague, or overly contrived. <em>Class A
                inherits from Class B which depends on Class C.</em> Unless you're
                making a weird alphabet app, that kind of treatment isn't going
                to be very useful. The examples in this book are relatable.

                The implementation language is old, irrelevant, or pseudocode.

                The book includes an extensive Appendix to help new developers

                They aren't written with real world business problems in mind.
                The seminal work in software design patterns includes examples
                on UI design in MOTIF, and algorithms for managing lines on
                printed circuit boards.
                <strong
                  >You need a book (like this one) that focuses on the kinds of

              </li>
              <li>
                They aren't written from a real-world perspective. Does your
                code break? Do you sometimes run with an idea only to find it
                doesn't work out? Have you ever noticed that in most books, that
                never happens?
                <strong

              <li>
                They go for quantity over quality. Trying to cover every
                software pattern ever conceived is a noble endeavor, but it's
                like trying to document every feature in Excel. Did you know
                Excel can sum a column of numbers? Of course! Did you know there
                is an Excel function to convert your numbers into Roman
                numerals? Some of the patterns outlined in longer books are
                about as useful. You need a book that focuses on the patterns
                you'll really use. <strong>That's what this book does!</strong>

            This book focuses entirely on reality, warts and all. It presents
            the story of two sisters, Kitty and Phoebe, who create a tech
            startup aimed at building the finest bicycles the world has ever
            seen. The girls are not professional software developers, so they
            have to learn as they go.&nbsp; They have business objectives and
            very real competitive pressures just like you do.&nbsp; Left to
            their own devices, their code will turn into a big ball of mud on a
            plate of spaghetti.&nbsp;&nbsp;

          <p class="block">
            We start off with some anti-patterns: those practices everybody does
            because either they're lazy, or they cut corners because they're under extreme pressure to
            ship before the code is ready.&nbsp; These conditions can be
            corrected with regular refactoring and code reviews, but they
            usually aren't.&nbsp; The anti-patterns we cover include:

            Meet Kitty and Phoebe – Texas-born sisters who share a love for
            riding bicycles. Phoebe is studying engineering at Southern
            Methodist University, a private university in the sisters’ hometown
            of Dallas, Texas. Kitty is studying industrial design at Sul Ross
            University in the town of Alpine located in west Texas. Purely
            through kismet, they both won a summer internship at MegaBikeCorp, a
            large multi-national bicycle manufacturing company.

          <p class="block">
            After three months of soul crushging big-company bureaucracy, the girls decided
            they could do better. Kitty designs a new line of incredibly
            innovative bicycles. Her sister has the idea to create an automated
            robotic assembly line. The sisters find two abandoned warehouses:
            one in Dallas, the other in the city of Alpine. The two set up shop
            with the help of their father's credit card. (Don't worry, they pay
            him back!)
          </p>
          <p class="block">
            Throughout the story, the sisters are working on building the
            software systems that will control their robotic manufacturing
            facilities. You'll be working alongside them, learning as they do,
            and occasionally making mistakes, and then correcting them.

            The plot of our story takes a dire turn and the heroic sisters must

            In the real world, your business needs to be able to pivot on a dime
            to capture new markets and new opportunities. If your software
            architecture isn't resilient and flexible, you could miss out. The
            only way to have a flexible architecture is to follow SOLID
            principles and utilize patterns.  Stretched thin by their current business committements, the girls have 
            to recruit some help from a skilled developer most companies probably wouldn't hire.  Will this unlikely 
            hero save they day using the patterns learned in the earlier chapters?
