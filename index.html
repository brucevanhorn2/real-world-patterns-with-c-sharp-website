                An AHA! moment with software design patterns
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p class="block">
                For 30 years now I have derived a great deal of satisfaction teaching new and new-ish software
                developers
                our trade. There's just something about seting the AHA! moment when suddenly a tough or opaque concept
                clicks in my colleague's mind. The world for them has opened to new possibilities, even if they are
                small. When Packt Publishing approached me about a book on design patterns, I jumped at the chance.
            </p>
            <p class="block">
                Software development as a profession has been around for 50 over years now. As an industry, we’re pretty
                good at teaching new languages, and basic theory like algorithms, data structures, Big O notation and
                the like. But there
                is a difference between software development and software engineering. Engineers need to be able to
                think
                about more than just syntax and clever use of linked lists. They also need to learn programming
                paradigms
                and how to software design leverage patterns as both a communications tool and as an advantage when
                designing well written, easily maintainable code.
            </p>
            <p class="block">
                Developers working with C# will be able to put their knowledge to work with this practical guide to
                design
                patterns. The book provides a hands-on approach to implementation and associated methodologies that will
                have you up-and-running, and productive in no time.
            </p>
            <p class="block">
                Complete with step-by-step explanations of essential concepts, practical examples and self-assessment
                questions, you will begin by exploring some what patterns are, how to leverage them in your daily work,
                and even how to recognize and correct for anti-patterns that invariably work their way into our
                projects.
            </p>
            <p class="block">
                You’ll learn to recognize solutions to common problems in software design with C# that come up time and
                again regardless of where you work or what industry you serve. Rather than an academic treatment that
                you’ll find in “classic” books on this topic, we’ll be exploring real-world applications of design
                patterns that you can use in your everyday work.
            </p>
            <p class="block">
                By the end of this book, you’ll be able to recognize situations where you are tempted to reinvent the
                wheel, and quickly avoid the time and cost associated with solving problems that are common, well
                understood, with battle tested, and proven design patterns.
            </p>
            <p>You'll wield patterns with confidence and you do it with CLASS! And sometimes interfaces.</p>

            <p class="title is-4">Most books on patterns have one or more problems:</p>
            <div class="block">
                <ol>
                    <li>They are written by university professors for other university professors. These people have
                        never had to ship real software on a deadline. Learning from them is like learning to play a
                        musical instrument from someone who has only ever listened to the radio.
                    </li>
                    <li>The authors played it safe and made every example super-vague. Class A inherits from Class B
                        which depends on Class C. Unless you're making a weird alphabet app, that kind of treatment
                        isn't going to be very useful.
                    </li>
                    <li>The implementation language is old, irrelevant, or pseudocode. You need to learn patterns in a
                        language you can actually use. C# is a popular choice.
                    </li>
                    <li>They aren't written with real world business problems in mind. The seminal work in software
                        design patterns includes examples on UI design in MOTIF, and algorithms for managing lines on
                        printed circuit boards. You need a book that focuses on the kinds of business scenarios you're
                        actually going to see in your work.
                    </li>
                    <li>They aren't written from a real-world perspective. Does your code break? Do you sometimes run
                        with an idea only to find it doesn't work out? Have you ever noticed that in most books, that
                        never happens. The code is perfect the first time, every time. What you need is a book that is
                        honest, shows the common mistakes we all make, and how to fix them.
                    </li>
                    <li>They go for quantity over quality. Trying to cover every software pattern ever conceived is a
                        noble endeavor, but it's like trying to document every feature in Excel. Did you know you can
                        sum a column in Excel? Of course you did. Have you ever needed to run a two-tailed T-test or a
                        biased ANOVA? Probably not since college, and you didn't use Excel for that. And yet those
                        features are buried in the documentation. You need to focus on the most useful, widely used
                        patterns instead of trying to learn them all.
                    </li>

            This book focuses entirely on reality, warts and all.  It presents the story of two sisters, Kitty and Phoebe, who create a tech startup aimed at building the finest bicycles the world has ever seen.  The girls are not professional software developers, so they have to learn as they go.&nbsp; They have business objectives and very real competitive pressures just like you do.&nbsp; Left to their own devices, their code will turn into a big ball of mud on a plate of spaghetti.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          We start off with some anti-patterns:  those practices everybody does because either they're lazy, or they're under extreme pressure to ship before the code is ready.&nbsp; These conditions can be corrected with regular refactoring and code reviews, but they usually aren't.&nbsp; Even if your code starts out clean and shiny, there are&nbsp;</p>

                Meet Kitty and Phoebe – Texas-born sisters who share a love for riding bicycles. Phoebe is studying 
                engineering at Southern Methodist University, a private university in the sisters’ hometown of Dallas, 
                Texas. Kitty is studying industrial design at Sul Ross University in the town of Alpine located in west 
                Texas. Purely through kismet, they both won a summer internship at MegaBikeCorp, a large multi-national 
                bicycle manufacturing company.

                After three months of big-company bureacracy, the girls decided they could do better.  Kitty designs
                a new line of incredibly innovative bicycles.  Her sister has the idea to create an automated robotic
                assembly line.  The sisters find two abandoned warehouses; one in Dallas, the other in the city of
                Alpine. The two set up shop with the help of their father's credit card.

                Throughout the story, the sisters are working on building the software systems that will control their
                robotic manufacturing facilities.  You'll be working alongside them, learning as they do, and occasionally
                making mistakes, and then correcting them.
